Start the development server.

Steps:

1. Check if port 3000 is available
2. If port is in use, offer to kill the existing process or use a different port
3. Run `npm run dev` in the background
4. Wait for the server to be ready (look for "Ready" in output)
5. Report the URL (http://localhost:3000) and any startup warnings
